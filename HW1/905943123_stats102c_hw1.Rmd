### Problem 1: Suppose X is a geometric random variable with $p = 0.3$, determine the value of k such that $P(X \le k) \simeq 0.8$

$$X\sim Geometric(0.3)$$
$$P(X\le k) = 1-(1-p)^k\simeq 0.8$$
$$1-0.7^k \simeq 0.8$$
$$0.7^k \simeq 0.2$$
$$k = \frac{log(0.2)}{log(0.7)}$$

```{r}
print(paste("k =",log(0.2)/log(0.7)))
```


### Problem 2: If two random variables, X and Y, are independent, show Var(XY) in terms of the expected values and variances of X and Y.
